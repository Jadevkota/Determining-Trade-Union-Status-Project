# Determining-Trade-Union-Status-Project
This Project deals with implementation of different models and doing preprocessing with the data in order to compare the results and performance of different models. We applied statistical techniques to see which model is performing best. In this project we will create a binary classifier which will predict that either the data scientist will remaina USDU member or not.
